# Qadsiah Predictions — World Cup 2026

**Branding:** logos only, no brand-name text — the official "WE ARE 26" tournament mark (`public/images/logo.png`) plus the white club crest extracted from the official backdrop (`public/images/club-crest.png`). The former فارس المونديال / "Mondial Knight" name and knight emblem were dropped (June 2026) and must not reappear in UI copy; page titles use "نادي القادسية — كأس العالم 2026". The repo/project name stays `qadsiah-predictions`.

A public, QR-code-driven score prediction site for Al-Qadsiah FC. Employees watching Saudi national team matches at the club venue scan a poster QR, enter **name + phone** (no account), and predict the exact score. After the match, the exact-score predictors become winners (if nobody is exact the match has no winners), and a **lucky wheel** is spun live on the venue projector to pick the prize winner.

**Client:** Al-Qadsiah FC (Saudi Arabia)
**Sibling project:** `../reda-predictions` (same stack, but that one uses per-employee Firebase Auth accounts, points and leaderboards — this project has none of that)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React 19 + TypeScript 6 |
| Build | Vite 8 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 (`@theme` tokens in `src/index.css`) |
| DB / Auth | Firebase Firestore + Auth (admin only), Spark free tier |
| Routing | React Router 7 |
| i18n | react-i18next (Arabic default + English, RTL-first) |
| Icons | Lucide React |
| Toasts | sonner |
| Wheel FX | canvas-confetti |
| QR | qrcode |
| Tests | Vitest |

**Hosting:** Netlify (SPA redirect in `netlify.toml` + one serverless function: the football-data.org proxy). No Cloud Functions — all app logic is client-side, enforced by Firestore rules.

**No React Query** (unlike reda) — live data uses plain `onSnapshot` hooks; the app is small enough that a query cache adds nothing.

## Brand / Theme

World Cup 2026 club palette, sampled from the official backdrop artwork the client provided (June 2026 — replaced the original yellow/red club colors): **bright green `#45B75A`** (primary) and **lime `#B4D337`** (accent), with deep teal `#0B4C40` / flag green `#0B5332` as artwork surfaces, on a green near-black background. Gold stays as an artwork-only accent (the trophy). Dark-only UI (class `dark` hardcoded on `<html>`). Fonts match reda-predictions: **Space Grotesk** for Latin (`--font-sans`), **Cairo** for Arabic (`--font-arabic`, applied via a `[dir="rtl"] body` rule), **Bebas Neue** for big score digits (`--font-display`). Theme tokens live in `src/index.css` under `@theme`.

## Firestore Collections

### `matches`
Generic two-team fixture (the main event is Saudi matches, but the admin can add any WC game for testing/screenings). `home`/`away` is just fixture order — the tournament is on neutral ground, so the UI labels teams "first/second", never home/away, and there are no venue fields. Key fields: `home`/`away` (`TeamInfo`: `{name, nameAr, flag, crest?}` — manual create defaults the first team to Saudi Arabia), `stage`, `matchDate`, `status` (`"upcoming" | "completed"` — "locked" is **derived from the clock**, never stored), `actualScoreHome/Away`, `winnerTier` (`"exact"` or `null`), `winnersCount`, `prizeWinner` (`{predictionId, name, phoneMasked} | null`), `wheelSpins[]` (every spin incl. re-spins), `apiMatchId`.

`snapToMatch()` normalizes legacy pre-refactor docs (`opponent`+`saudiIsHome` shape) on read so they render and can be deleted — but delete any such test docs rather than keeping them.

### `predictions` — doc ID = `{matchId}_{sha256(normalizedPhone)}`
`matchId`, `name`, `phoneMasked` ("050•••••67"), `predictedScoreHome/Away`, `isWinner`, `winnerTier`, `goalError`. **Never contains a raw phone.**

### `contacts` — doc ID mirrors the prediction ID
`matchId`, `name`, `phone` (full, normalized `+9665XXXXXXXX`). **Admin-only read.**

### `admins` — doc per admin UID
Created manually in the Firebase console; client can never write.

---

## Security model (the important part)

Participants are anonymous — there is no Firebase Auth for them — so all integrity comes from Firestore rules + doc-ID design:

1. **Phone identity without exposure:** prediction doc IDs embed `sha256(phone)`. The public `predictions` collection allows `get` to anyone (you must know the phone to compute the ID = you can only fetch your own) but allows `list` **only when the parent match is completed** (winners display) or for the admin. Full phones live in `contacts`, admin-read-only.
2. **Kickoff lock is server-side:** create/update rules compare `match.matchDate > request.time`. No cron or admin action needed; the UI countdown is cosmetic.
3. **One prediction per phone per match:** deterministic doc ID makes a second submission an overwrite, not a duplicate.
4. **Winner fields are admin-only:** public writes must have `isWinner == false`, `winnerTier == null`, `goalError == null`.
5. **Accepted risk (client signed off):** no OTP — someone who knows a colleague's phone number could overwrite that colleague's prediction. Fine for an internal venue event.

---

## Winner & wheel rules

- Winner = exact final score only. If nobody predicted the exact score, the match has **no winners**. `goalError` (`|Δhome| + |Δaway|`) is still recorded per prediction for the admin table.
- `enterResult()` recomputes everything idempotently; re-entering a corrected score **resets `prizeWinner` and `wheelSpins`** (the winner pool changed), so the wheel must be re-spun.
- The wheel (`/admin/wheel/:matchId`) picks with `crypto.getRandomValues`, animates ~7s, saves `prizeWinner` + appends to `wheelSpins`. **Re-spin** (winner not in the room) excludes previously drawn names — tracked locally too, so an instant re-spin can't re-draw the same person before the snapshot lands.

---

## Football API integration (football-data.org)

Same account/key as reda-predictions (free tier, 10 req/min, admin-only usage). All calls go through a same-origin `/football-api/*` proxy that injects `X-Auth-Token` server-side:

- **Dev:** Vite proxy in `vite.config.ts` (reads `FOOTBALL_API_KEY` from `.env` — no `VITE_` prefix, so it never enters the client bundle).
- **Prod:** `netlify/functions/football-proxy.mts` (set `FOOTBALL_API_KEY` in Netlify Site settings → Environment variables). The `netlify.toml` redirect for `/football-api/*` must stay above the SPA fallback.

Two admin features (`src/lib/football-api.ts`):
1. **Import from API** (`/admin` → "Import from API"): fetches all WC matches (competition 2000) with a **Saudi matches / All matches** toggle (all-matches mode exists for testing the app on earlier WC games), marks already-imported ones (`apiMatchId` on the match doc), and prefills the create-match modal — team EN/AR names + flags come from `src/lib/team-mappings.ts`, which covers all 48 WC-2026 teams (verified against the live API). Unmapped teams (future-proofing) fall back to the API name + the football-data.org **crest URL** stored on `TeamInfo.crest`, which `TeamFlag` renders in preference to the flagcdn flag.
2. **Sync score** (match detail → "Sync score from API", shown only for imported matches): fetches the live/full-time score into the result steppers; the admin still clicks save to commit (winner computation + wheel reset are deliberate actions). Imported matches keep the API's home/away order, so scores map directly.

WC 2026 verified live (June 2026): Saudi group matches are Uruguay (537370), Spain (537371), Cape Verde (537374). API stage `LAST_32`/`ROUND_OF_32`/`PLAYOFF_ROUND` map to stage `round32`.

---

## i18n

- Arabic **default** (localStorage-only detection — browser locale is ignored), English toggle. `dir` flips on `<html>` per language.
- Namespaces: `common`, `admin` (`src/i18n/locales/{ar,en}/`).
- Arabic plural forms (`_zero/_one/_two/_few/_many/_other`) used for winner counts.
- Dates formatted with explicit **Gregorian** calendar (`ar-SA-u-ca-gregory-nu-latn`) — some browsers default ar-SA to Hijri.
- Phone input accepts Arabic-Indic digits (`٠٥٠…`) — normalized in `lib/phone.ts`.

---

## Firebase setup (new environment)

1. Create a Firebase project, enable **Authentication → Email/Password** and **Firestore**.
2. Register a web app, copy the config into `.env` (see `.env.example`).
3. Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` (or paste `firestore.rules` into the console).
4. In Authentication, create the admin user; copy their UID.
5. In Firestore, create doc `admins/{thatUid}` with any content (e.g. `{ createdAt: now }`).
6. Deploy to Netlify; build command and SPA redirect are in `netlify.toml`.
7. From `/admin`, download the QR PNG for the venue poster.

No composite indexes needed (equality-only queries; sorting is client-side).

## Known trade-offs / future work

- **Lucide bundle:** lucide-react 1.x doesn't tree-shake under Vite — icons ship as one ~125 kB gzip cached chunk (reda-predictions ships the same way). Could switch to per-icon deep imports if mobile load time matters.
- No public "X people predicted" counter — would require public list/count access before completion, which the privacy rules intentionally block.
- `prizeWinner.phoneMasked` is shown on the public winners page so same-named winners are distinguishable; full numbers are never public.
